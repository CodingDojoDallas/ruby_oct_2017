We're going to add another model (Comment) to our Blogs/Posts/Messages assignment
  rails g model Comment commentable:references{polymorphic}

allow the user to leave a comment for either a user, blog, post or a message
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable (you put this line in each preexisting table in order for all of them to connect to the new one)

Test using the console and make sure it allows you to add, update, delete comments for a user, blog, post, and a message.
  ADD 1-Comment.create(content:"this is the story of a girl...") (this worked, but had to go back in and update the commentable columns)
    UPDATE- Comment.first.update(commentable_id:1, commentable_type:"Blog")
  ADD 2-Comment.create(commentable:User.first, content:"this is the story of a girl") (this is the correct way to create a commentable row)
  DELETE - Comment.third.delete
